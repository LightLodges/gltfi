## About: 
Open source tooling and shortcode for glTF asset sharing and portability, tracking and extensions
Welcome to the Javascript URL Shortener for glTF 3D assets! This open source tool allows you to easily share and embed glTF 3D assets, art, and other resources on the web.

The goal of this tool is to provide a simple and easy-to-use solution for sharing and embedding glTF assets on the web, while also giving proper attribution to the creators of these assets. To accomplish this, we have implemented a number of features including:

    Automatic generation of short URLs for glTF assets
    Embedding of glTF assets in web pages using an iframe
    Attribution of creators using the glTF metadata
    Support for multiple file formats, including .gltf, .glb, and .zip

The tool is built using Javascript and is available as open source code on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/LightLodges/gltfi. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help improve and expand the tool.

To get started with the Javascript URL Shortener for glTF 3D assets, simply upload a glTF asset to the tool and it will generate a short URL that you can share and embed in your web pages. Be sure to give proper attribution to the creators of the assets you share using the metadata provided in the glTF files.

Thank you for using the Javascript URL Shortener for glTF 3D assets and we hope it helps you easily share and embed glTF assets on the web.
